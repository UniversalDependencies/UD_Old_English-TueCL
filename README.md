# Summary

This is a small UD treebank of Old English with 100 sentences from ParCorOEv2 (currently on [v3]( https://www.nerthusproject.com/about-us)). 


# Introduction

LEMMA and UPOS are taken from the source with minor adaptation. The morphological features are converted from the source annotation with a script to fit the CoNLL-U format. All sentences are manually annotated. Due to its small size, there is no split into different sets.


# Acknowledgments

I am grateful to Dr Çağrı Çöltekin for his encouragement and guidance.
